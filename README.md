# twitternlp
A natural language processing project based on python. 

The project has three parts: data-scraping from twitter, some data analysis (histogram, wordcloud, etc.) and sentiment analysis.

The python package "Tweepy" is used to scrape tweets that contains a given keyword. More info on the package can be found on the official website. 

The python packages "nltk" and "textblob" are used for sentiment analysis. "nltk" categorizes tweets into three groups, positive, neutral and negative emotions, while "textblob" only offers two categories, positive and negative.
